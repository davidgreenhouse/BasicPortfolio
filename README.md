# BasicPortfolio
Portfolio built with HTML and CSS

This Project is to start building a personal portfolio, starting from the basics of HTML and CSS, to be able to show my projects and other information about myself with potential hiring managers in the future. While the page is crude and basic so far, the plan is to contantly be tweaking and updating the page with the newer code weekly.
